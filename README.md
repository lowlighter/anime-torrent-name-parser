A parser to extract informations and metadata from anime torrents filename.
With this, it'll be easier to script anime torrents related stuff !


## üíª Usage

### ü¶ù [Website](https://rakun.app)

If you want to use Rakun online, you can visit the website by [@Wamy-Dev](https://github.com/Wamy-Dev/Rakun.app) at [rakun.app](https://rakun.app).


### üì¶ Installation

You can either use default npm registry (`https://registry.npmjs.org`) or the GitHub package registry (`https://npm.pkg.github.com`).
```bash
npm install @lowlighter/rakun --save
```

### ‚è™ With the following code...

```typescript
import rakun from "rakun"
console.log(rakun.parse("[Team246] Ghost in the shell Stand alone complex S01 E10-E15 [BDREMUX 1080P MULTi DTSHDMA 5.1][VOSTFR]"))
```

### ‚è© You'll get the following output :

```typescript
{
  filename:"[Team246] Ghost in the shell Stand alone complex S01 E10-E15 [BDREMUX 1080P MULTi DTSHDMA 5.1][VOSTFR]",
  subber:"Team246",
  name:"Ghost in the shell Stand alone complex",
  season:"1",
  episode:"10-15",
  resolution:"1080p",
  audio:"multi vo",
  subtitles:"fr",
  source:"bluray",
  codecs:"audio_5_1 dts_hdma",
  meta:"remux",
}
```

### üìä What's rakun performances ?

We try to gather a lot of different torrents name format from all over the net to make **rakun** more efficient and reliable.
You can check [tests cases](https://github.com/lowlighter/rakun/tree/master/tests/cases) to see what kind of formatting is currently supported.

Below is an excerpt of tests cases which may help you to check **rakun**'s capabilities :

### üìë Extracted informations

Below is the descriptor of the possible extreacted torrent informations.
Multiple values properties (codecs, audio, subtitles, etc.) are sorted to keep consistancy.

```typescript
/** Torrent informations. */
  interface TorrentInfos {
    //Original filename
      readonly filename:string
    //Cleaned name
      readonly name:string
    //Hash
      readonly hash?:string
    //File extension
      readonly extension?:string
    //Resolution
      readonly resolution?:string
    //Source (Bluray, DVD, etc.)
      readonly source?:string
    //Codecs
      readonly codecs?:string
    //Audio language
      readonly audio?:string
    //Subtitles language
      readonly subtitles?:string
    //Subber group (or translation group)
      readonly subber?:string
    //Website of subber
      readonly website?:string
    //Content producer/distributor
      readonly distributor?:string
    //Torrent other metadata (remux, repack, etc.)
      readonly meta?:string
    //Movie
      readonly movie?:string
    //Season
      readonly season?:string
    //Part
      readonly part?:string
    //Episode (or episode range)
      readonly episode?:string
  }
```

## üîß Under the hood

### üß¨ ATNP's logic

Parsing follows the following workflow :
* An input `filename` is given, with possible parser `options`
* Pre-processors are executed
* Main processor iterates through the [collection of regexs](https://github.com/lowlighter/rakun/tree/master/src/regexs) to extract informations from `filename`
  * At each iteration, extracted informations can be either removed from `filename` through [cleaners](https://github.com/lowlighter/rakun/blob/master/src/regexs/cleaners.ts) are applied to remove remnants, or keept for next iteration for closely related informations (like season, parts and episode)
* Post-processors are executed
* The remaining part of `filename` is considered as the cleaned title
* Extracted informations are returned

#### üì∞ Additional informations

Regexs are ordered to match first what can be accurately extracted and removed early (like hash, extension, website, etc.) to ease the remaining extraction.

Except for cleaners and specials regexs, they should have named capture groups. (if capture group are needed). It allows easier understanding of regexs, but it is also the way that the parser register data. 

The main processor is a list of descriptors with the following properties :
```typescript
{
  key?:string,                      // Property to set (e.g. audio, episode, meta, etc..)
  collection?:RegExp[],             // Regex collection to use
  get?:"key"|"value",               // If "key", will return capture group's name ; if "value", will return capture group's value
  mode?:"append"|"replace"|"skip",  // If "append", add value (or create) to property ; if "replace", replace property ; if "skip", skip if property already defined
  clean?:boolean,                   // If true, cleaners will be applied at the end of the iteration
  cleaners?:RegExp[]                // Additional cleaners to apply
}
```

While the aim is to reach 100% accuracy, note that this objective is nearly impossible since there are too much outliers in naming conventions across various websites.

### üèÖ Code quality

To ensure a quality library, code is required to pass **Onee-chan**'s judgement and fulfill a parsing accuracy of at least **85%** of defined [test cases](https://github.com/lowlighter/rakun/tree/master/tests/cases).

Pull requests may not be merged if they do not reach this standard, unless they are adding revelant tests which may reveal missed matches in current builds. Although edges cases should be integrated to challenge **rakun**, simpler cases should also be added to not biases **Onee-chan**'s evaluation.
